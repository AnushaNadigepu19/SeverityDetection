# SeverityDetection
The objective of this Project is to find out the severity of a Mammographic mass to decide on the type of treatment to be provided. Mammography is the most effective method for breast cancer screening available today. However, breast biopsy's low positive predictive value resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to approximately 70% unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes. Several computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been proposed in the last years to reduce this high number of unnecessary breast biopsies. These systems help physicians decide to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious lesion seen in a mammogram or perform a short-term follow-up examination instead.
